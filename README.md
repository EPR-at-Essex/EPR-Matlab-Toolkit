# EPR-Matlab-Toolkit
Matlab scripts for some tasks related to EPR spectra processing and simulation.  

This repository contains Matlab scripts and functions developed for the analysis and visualisation of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) data. The scripts were written in the context of studies on proteins and enzymes, but many of the routines are applicable to other EPR data as well.

The aim of this repository is simply to share code that may be useful for others working in the EPR community. The scripts are provided as is. I am not actively maintaining or extending them, though suggestions and comments are welcome.

## Contents

The repository includes several independent pieces of code. Each script or function has its own internal description and usage notes. Please refer to the comments at the top of each file for details.
